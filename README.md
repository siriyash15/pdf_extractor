# 🧾 PDF_Extractor

This project is a Python tool that automatically extracts an outline structured  from PDF documents by considering the visual layout and format of the text. It identifies the main titles, such as the title, H1, H2 and H3, based on the size and style of the font, and creating a clear and decentralized JSON structure. This tool operates completely offline, helping it fit the safe environment and is designed to quickly handle large PDF files. It is perfect for tasks such as summarizing documents, smart research and creating dynamic content tables.
## 📦 Features
🌐 Multilingual Heading Detection
Support documents written in English, Hindi, Japanese and other  languages based on Unicode - ideal for global users and different data sets.

🚀 Fast & Lightweight
Uses PyMuPDF for high-speed parsing without relying on large machine learning models — processes 50-page PDFs in seconds.

🧠 Smart Visual Hierarchy Recognition
Identifies headings like Title, H1, H2, and H3 based on font size, style, and layout — the operation even on the non -marked PDF files or scanned  with text layers.

🔒 Offline & Privacy-Preserving
Runs entirely on your local machine — no cloud, no API keys, no data leakage.

🐳 Easy to Deploy Anywhere
Comes with a ready-to-use Docker container — one command to run on any platform or environment.
